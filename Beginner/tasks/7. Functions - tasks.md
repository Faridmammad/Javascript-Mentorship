# 🧪 JavaScript: Functions — tasks

Welcome to the **Functions tasks**!  
This test checks your understanding of **JavaScript functions**.  
Complete all tasks in your `script.js` file and verify results in the browser console.

> 📝 Instructions:
> 1. Create `index.html` and `script.js`
> 2. Link script: `<script src="script.js"></script>`
> 3. Write all code in `script.js`
> 4. Open `index.html` and check console (`F12`)
> 5. Complete all 10 tasks — each is worth 10 points

Call it with `7` and `3`, and print the result.



---

## Task 5: Boolean return (10 points)

## Task 6: Conditional return (10 points)

Create a function `canDrive(age)` that returns:
