# 🧩 JavaScript: Operators and Expressions — tasks

Welcome to the practice section for **Operators and Expressions**!  
Complete these tasks to master math, comparisons, and logic in JavaScript.  
Write real code in your `script.js` file and test it in the browser.

> 📝 How to start:
> 1. Create `index.html` and `script.js`
> 2. Link script: `<script src="script.js"></script>`
> 3. Write your code in `script.js`
> 4. Open `index.html` in browser and check console (`F12`)

---

## Task 1: Basic math

Declare two variables: `a = 15`, `b = 4`.  
Calculate and print:
- Sum: `a + b`
- Difference: `a - b`
- Product: `a * b`
- Quotient: `a / b`
- Remainder: `a % b`


---

## Task 2: Use assignment operators

Start with `let score = 100;`  
Then:
- Decrease by 20 using `-=`
- Multiply by 1.5 using `*=`
- Divide by 2 using `/=`
- Print final score

---

## Task 3: Even or odd?

Declare a variable `num = 7`.  
Use `%` and `===` to check if it’s even.  
Print `true` if even, `false` if odd.

Try with different numbers.

---

## Task 4: Compare ages

Declare two variables: `age1 = 25`, `age2 = 30`.  
Check and print:
- Is `age1` greater than `age2`?
- Are they equal? (use `===`)
- Is `age1` less than or equal to `age2`?

Example:
```javascript
console.log(age1 > age2); // false
```  


---

## Task 5: Strict vs loose equality

Test these comparisons and print results:
- `5 == "5"`
- `5 === "5"`
- `0 == false`
- `0 === false`
- `null == undefined`
- `null === undefined`


> 💡 Note the difference!

---

## Task 6: Logical AND (`&&`)

Declare:
- `hasTicket = true`
- `isStudent = false`

Check if person can enter (needs ticket AND is student).  
Print result.

---

## Task 7: Logical OR (`||`)

Declare:
- `isWeekend = false`
- `isHoliday = true`

Check if person can sleep in (if weekend OR holiday).  
Print result.

---

## Task 8: Logical NOT (`!`)

Declare `isRaining = true`.  
Print the opposite: `!isRaining`.


Use it in a message:
```javascript
console.log("Is it sunny? " + !isRaining);
``` 


---

## Task 9: Calculate total price

Declare:
- `price = 50`
- `taxRate = 0.18`

Calculate total: `price + (price * taxRate)`  
Print total.

---

## Task 10: Fix the Code

This code has errors. Find and fix them:

```javascript
let x = 10
let y = "10"
if (x = y) {
  console.log("Equal!")
}
``` 


---

## Task 11: Operator precedence

Predict and test:
```javascript
let result = 5 + 3 * 2;
console.log(result); // ?
``` 


Now use parentheses:
```javascript
let result2 = (5 + 3) * 2;
console.log(result2); // ?
``` 


Print both and see the difference.

---

## Task 12: typeof Practice

Use `typeof` to print the type of:
- `"Hello"`
- `42`
- `true`
- `[]`
- `{}`
- `null`
- `undefined`

Example:
```javascript
console.log(typeof "Hello"); // string
``` 


> 💡 Remember: `typeof null` returns `"object"` — it's a bug!

---

## Task 13: Combine Everything

Create variables:
- `age = 20`
- `hasID = true`
- `ticketPrice = 25`

Check if person can buy a ticket: must be 18+ AND have ID.  
If yes, print `"Ticket purchased for $X"` (use `ticketPrice`).  
If no, print `"Access denied."`

Use: `&&`, `>=`, `console.log()`

---

## Task 14: Bonus Challenge

Write a single expression that:
- Checks if a number is **positive AND even**
- Example: `num = 8` → `true`, `num = -4` → `false`, `num = 3` → `false`

Hint: `num > 0 && num % 2 === 0`

Test with different values.

---

## 🎯 Tips

- Use `console.log()` to check intermediate values
- Don’t forget semicolons
- Use `===` and `!==` for safe comparisons
- Test each task before moving to next
