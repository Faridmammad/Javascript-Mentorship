## Task 1: Declare Variables


Declare three variables:
```javascript
- `myName` (string) — your name
- `myAge` (number) — your age
- `likesCoding` (boolean) — `true` or `false`
```  

Print each of them using `console.log()`.

Example:
```javascript
- `myName` (string) — your name
- `myAge` (number) — your age
- `likesCoding` (boolean) — `true` or `false`
```

## Task 2: Use `const` and `let`

```javascript
- Declare a `const` variable `birthYear` and set it to your birth year.
- Declare a `let` variable `currentYear` and set it to `2025`.
- Calculate your age: `let age = currentYear - birthYear;`
- Print `age`.
```  

Try changing `birthYear` — what happens?
