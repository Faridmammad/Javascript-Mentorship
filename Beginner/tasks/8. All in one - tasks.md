# 🧩 JavaScript Beginner Level: All-in-one tasks

Welcome to the **complete practice section** for the **Beginner JavaScript** course!  
These tasks cover all core topics: variables, operators, conditionals, loops, and functions.

> 📝 How to use:
> 1. Create `index.html` and `script.js`
> 2. Link script: `<script src="script.js"></script>`
> 3. Write code in `script.js`
> 4. Open `index.html` in browser and check console (`F12`)
> 5. Complete one task at a time

## 🔤 Task 1: Variables and strings

Declare variables:
- `name` (your name)
- `city` (your city)
- `isLearning` (true or false)

Print a sentence: `"Hi, I'm [name] from [city]. Learning JS: [true/false]"`


---

## ➕ Task 2: Math and operators

Declare:
- `a = 8`
- `b = 3`

Calculate and print:
- Sum
- Difference
- Product
- Quotient
- Remainder (`%`)


---

## 🔀 Task 3: Conditional (if/else)

Declare `age = 17`.  
If age ≥ 18, print `"You can vote"`, else `"You cannot vote"`.


---

## 🔁 Task 4: For Loop

Use a `for` loop to print numbers from `1` to `7`.



---

## 🔁 Task 5: While loop

Do the same as Task 4, but using a `while` loop.


---

## 🔢 Task 6: Even numbers

Use a `for` loop to print **even numbers** from `1` to `10`.  
Use `% 2 === 0`.



---

## 📦 Task 7: Function (no parameters)

Create a function `sayWelcome()` that prints `"Welcome to JavaScript!"`.  
Call it twice.



---

## 📦 Task 8: Function with parameter

Create a function `greet(name)` that prints `"Hello, [name]!"`.  
Call it with your friend's name.



---

## 📦 Task 9: Function with return

Create a function `add(a, b)` that **returns** the sum.  
Call it with `5` and `4`, and print the result.



---

## 🔀 Task 10: if...else if (grades)

Declare `score = 82`.  
Print grade:
- 90+ → "A"
- 80-89 → "B"
- 70-79 → "C"
- Below 70 → "F"


---

## 🔁 Task 11: Countdown

Use a `for` loop to count down from `5` to `1`, then print `"Blast off! 🚀"`.


---

## 📦 Task 12: Function with logic

Create a function `canDrive(age)` that returns `"Yes"` if age ≥ 18, `"No"` otherwise.  
Call it with `16` and `20`, print results.

---

## 🔤 Task 13: String length

Declare `password = "abc123"`.  
If length ≥ 6, print `"Strong"`, else `"Weak"`.


---

## 🔢 Task 14: Sum of numbers

Use a `for` loop to calculate the sum of numbers from `1` to `10`.  
Print total.

---

## 🧩 Task 15: Fix the code

This code has errors. Find and fix them:

```javascript
let name = "Ali"
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello " + name)
}
greet
``` 





---

## 🎯 Bonus challenge

Write a function `isEvenAndPositive(num)` that returns `true` only if:
- `num` is even **AND**
- `num` is positive (> 0)

Test with: `4`, `-2`, `5`, `0`



---

## 📚 Tips

- Use `console.log()` to check values
- Test each task before moving to next
- Type code — don’t copy-paste
- Use meaningful variable names
- Always use `===` and `!==`
