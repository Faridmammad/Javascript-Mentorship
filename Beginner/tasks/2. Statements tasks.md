## ‚úèÔ∏è Exercise 1: Declare Variables

Declare three variables:
- `name` (string) ‚Äî your name
- `age` (number) ‚Äî your age
- `isStudent` (boolean) ‚Äî `true` or `false`

Then use `console.log()` to print each of them.

### Expected Output (example):
John  
25  
true

## ‚úèÔ∏è Exercise 2: Update and Reassign

1. Declare a variable `score` and set it to `0`.
2. Add `10` to `score`.
3. Multiply `score` by `2`.
4. Print the final value.

### Tip:
Use: `score = score + 10` or `score += 10`

## ‚úèÔ∏è Exercise 3: Greeting Function

Create a function called `greet()` that:
- Takes one parameter: `name`
- Prints: `"Hello, [name]! Welcome to JavaScript."`

Call the function with your name.

### Expected Output:  
Hello, Aydan! Welcome to JavaScript.


---

## ‚úèÔ∏è Exercise 4: Conditional Statement

Write a program that:
- Declares a variable `temperature` (e.g., 30)
- If `temperature` is greater than 25, print `"It's hot!"`
- Otherwise, print `"It's pleasant."`

Try changing the value to test both cases.

---

## ‚úèÔ∏è Exercise 5: For Loop

Use a `for` loop to print numbers from `1` to `10` in the console.

### Expected Output:  
1  
2  
3  
...  
10


---

## ‚úèÔ∏è Exercise 6: While Loop

Do the same as Exercise 5, but using a `while` loop.

Declare a variable `i = 1`, and increase it until it reaches 10.

---

## ‚úèÔ∏è Exercise 7: Function with Return

Create a function called `multiply(a, b)` that:
- Takes two numbers
- Returns their product

Then:
- Call the function with `4` and `5`
- Store the result in a variable
- Print the result

### Expected Output:  
20


---

## ‚úèÔ∏è Exercise 8: Combine Everything

Write a program that:
1. Declares a variable `userName` (your name).
2. Creates a function `canVote(age)` that:
   - Returns `"You can vote."` if age ‚â• 18
   - Returns `"You cannot vote yet."` otherwise
3. Calls the function with your age.
4. Prints a message: `"Hello, [userName]! [Result from canVote]"`

### Example Output:  
Hello, Emil! You can vote.


---

## ‚úÖ Bonus Challenge

Write a loop that prints only **even numbers** from `1` to `20`.  
Use the modulo operator: `i % 2 === 0`

### Expected Output:  
2  
4  
6  
...  
20

- Use `console.log()` to check your values.
- Test each exercise step by step.
- Don‚Äôt rush ‚Äî understanding is more important than finishing fast.
- If stuck, go back to the lesson or ask for help.
