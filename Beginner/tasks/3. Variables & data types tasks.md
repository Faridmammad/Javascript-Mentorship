# 🧩 JavaScript: Variables and Data Types — tasks

Welcome to the practice section for **Variables and Data Types**!  
Complete these tasks to strengthen your understanding.  
Write real code in your `script.js` file and test it in the browser.

> 📝 How to start:
> 1. Create `index.html` and `script.js`
> 2. Link script: `<script src="script.js"></script>`
> 3. Write your code in `script.js`
> 4. Open `index.html` in browser and check console (`F12`)

## Task 1: Declare variables


Declare three variables:
```javascript
- `myName` (string) — your name
- `myAge` (number) — your age
- `likesCoding` (boolean) — `true` or `false`
```  

Print each of them using `console.log()`.

Example:
```javascript
let myName = "Sevinj";
let myAge = 24;
let likesCoding = true;
console.log(myName);
console.log(myAge);
console.log(likesCoding);
```

## Task 2: Use `const` and `let`

```javascript
- Declare a `const` variable `birthYear` and set it to your birth year.
- Declare a `let` variable `currentYear` and set it to `2025`.
- Calculate your age: `let age = currentYear - birthYear;`
- Print `age`.
```  

Try changing `birthYear` — what happens?

## Task 3: Check data types

Create variables with different types:
```javascript
let country = "Azerbaijan";
let population = 9800000;
let isMountainous = true;
let president = null;
let vicePresident;
```  


Now use `typeof` to print each type:  

```javascript
console.log(typeof country);
console.log(typeof population);
console.log(typeof isMountainous);
console.log(typeof president);
console.log(typeof vicePresident);
```  


---

## Task 4: Fix the errors

This code has mistakes. Find and fix them:

```javascript
let name = Ali;
const age = 25
age = 26
console.log("Name: " + name)
console.log(typeof true
```  


---

## Task 5: Work with arrays

Create an array called `favoriteFoods` with 3 of your favorite foods.

Print:
- The whole array
- The first food (`[0]`)
- The length of the array

Example:
```javascript
let favoriteFoods = ["dolma", "plov", "sushi"];
console.log(favoriteFoods);
console.log(favoriteFoods[0]);
console.log(favoriteFoods.length);
``` 


---

## Task 6: Work with objects

Create an object called `friend` with:
- `name` (string)
- `age` (number)
- `city` (string)

Print:
- The whole object
- Just the name
- Just the city

Example:
```javascript
let friend = {
  name: "Kamran",
  age: 27,
  city: "Baku"
};
console.log(friend);
console.log(friend.name);
console.log(friend.city);
``` 


---

## Task 7: null vs undefined

Declare two variables:
- `car` with value `null`
- `motorcycle` without any value (just declare it)

Print both and their types:
```javascript
console.log(car);
console.log(motorcycle);
console.log(typeof car);
console.log(typeof motorcycle);
``` 


> 💡 Note: `typeof null` returns `"object"` — it's a known bug in JavaScript!

---

## Task 8: Reassign variables

- Declare `let mood = "happy";` and print it.
- Change `mood` to `"excited"` and print again.
- Now try the same with `const` — what happens?

Example:
```javascript
let mood = "happy";
console.log(mood);
mood = "excited";
console.log(mood);
``` 


---

## Task 9: Create your profile

Create variables for your profile:
- `fullName`
- `age`
- `isStudent`
- `hobby`
- `dreamJob` (set to `null` for now)
- `skills` (array of 3 skills)

Print a sentence like:
```javascript
console.log("Hi, I'm " + fullName + ", I'm " + age + " years old and I love " + hobby + ".");
``` 


---

## Task 10: Bonus challenge

Create an array of objects — your friends:
```javascript
let friends = [
  { name: "Ali", age: 25, city: "Ganja" },
  { name: "Nigar", age: 23, city: "Lankaran" },
  { name: "Tural", age: 27, city: "Baku" }
];
``` 


Print:
- The whole array
- The first friend’s name
- The last friend’s city

Use: `friends[0].name`, `friends[2].city`

## 🎯 Tips

- Use `console.log()` to check values
- Don’t copy-paste — type code yourself
- If you get an error, read it carefully
- Test one task at a time
