## üìå What is JavaScript?

**JavaScript (JS)** is a high-level, dynamic, and versatile programming language primarily used to make web pages interactive. It runs in the browser and allows you to:

- Respond to user actions (clicks, typing, etc.)
- Update content dynamically
- Control multimedia
- Animate elements
- Communicate with servers (via APIs)

> üí° Fun Fact: JavaScript is **NOT** related to Java. The name was a marketing decision in the 1990s!

## üåê Where Does JavaScript Run?

JavaScript can run in many environments:

- **Web Browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) ‚Äî most common
- **Servers** (using Node.js)
- **Mobile Apps** (React Native, etc.)
- **Desktop Apps** (Electron)

For now, we‚Äôll focus on **browser-based JavaScript**.

## ‚úÖ How to Write JavaScript

There are three main ways to include JavaScript in a web page:

### 1. Inline (not recommended for large code)
```html
<button onclick="alert('Hello!')">Click me</button>
```

### 2. Internal Script (inside HTML)
```html
<script>
  console.log("Hello from internal script!");
</script>
```

### 3. External Script (recommended)
Create a file called script.js:
```javascript
console.log("Hello from external file!");
```


Then link it in your HTML:
```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

> **Note:** ‚úÖ Best Practice: Always use external scripts for better organization and reusability.
