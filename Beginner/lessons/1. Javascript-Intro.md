# üöÄ JavaScript Introduction

Welcome to the **Beginner Level** of our JavaScript Mentorship Program!  
In this lesson, we'll cover the basics of JavaScript ‚Äî what it is, why it's important, and how to write your first lines of code.

---

## üìå What is JavaScript?

**JavaScript (JS)** is a high-level, dynamic, and versatile programming language primarily used to make web pages interactive. It runs in the browser and allows you to:

- Respond to user actions (clicks, typing, etc.)
- Update content dynamically
- Control multimedia
- Animate elements
- Communicate with servers (via APIs)

> üí° Fun Fact: JavaScript is **NOT** related to Java. The name was a marketing decision in the 1990s!

---

## üåê Where does JavaScript run?

JavaScript can run in many environments:

- **Web Browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) ‚Äî most common
- **Servers** (using Node.js)
- **Mobile Apps** (React Native, etc.)
- **Desktop Apps** (Electron)

For now, we‚Äôll focus on **browser-based JavaScript**.

## ‚úÖ How to write JavaScript

There are three main ways to include JavaScript in a web page:

### 1. Inline (not recommended for large code)
```html
<button onclick="alert('Hello!')">Click me</button>
```

### 2. Internal script (inside HTML)
```html
<script>
  console.log("Hello from internal script!");
</script>
```

### 3. External script (recommended)
Create a file called script.js:
```javascript
console.log("Hello from external file!");
```


Then link it in your HTML:
```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

> **Note:** ‚úÖ Best Practice: Always use external scripts for better organization and reusability.

<br><br>
## Your first JavaScript code

Let‚Äôs write a simple script that shows a message.

### Step 1: Create an HTML file (`index.html`)
```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>My First JS Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```


### Step 2: Create `script.js`
```javascript
// This is a comment
alert("Hello, JavaScript learner!");
console.log("This message appears in the browser's console.");
```

### Step 3: Open `index.html` in your browser
You should see an alert popup and a message in the browser console (`F12` to open DevTools).

<br><br>
## Understanding the console

The **browser console** is your best friend as a JavaScript developer.
- Open it with `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+J` (Cmd+Option+J on Mac)
- Use `console.log()` to print values and debug your code

Example:
```javascript
console.log("Hello");
console.log(34);
console.log(true);
```

## Basic concepts you need to know

### 1. Variables
Variables store data. Use `let`, `const`, or `var` to declare them.

```javascript
let name = "Ali";
const age = 25; // can't be changed later
var oldStyle = "avoid this"; // older way, not recommended
```

> ‚úÖ Use `const` by default, `let` when you need to reassign.

### 2. Data Types
JavaScript has several basic types:

| Type       | Example                     |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| String     | `"Hello"`                   |
| Number     | `42`, `3.14`                |
| Boolean    | `true`, `false`             |
| Null       | `null`                      |
| Undefined  | `undefined`                 |
| Object     | `{ name: "Ali" }`           |
| Array      | `[1, 2, 3]`                 |

### 3. Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code.
```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
console.log(greet("Zeynab")); // Output: Hello, Zeynab!
```


### 4. Conditionals
Make decisions in your code.
```javascript
let age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
  console.log("You are a minor.");
}
```


### 5. Loops
Repeat actions.
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("Count: " + i);
}
```
