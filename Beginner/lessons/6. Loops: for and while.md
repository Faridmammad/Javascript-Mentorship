# 🔁 JavaScript: Loops (for and while)

Welcome to the next lesson of our **Beginner Level** JavaScript program!  
In this lesson, you'll learn how to **repeat actions** using **loops** — a powerful way to automate repetitive tasks.

## What is a loop?

A **loop** lets you run the same code multiple times without writing it over and over.

Think of real life:
> "Brush your teeth 20 times" → you don’t write it 20 times, you repeat the action.

In JavaScript, we use `for` and `while` loops to do this.

## 1. `for` loop

The most common loop. Used when you know **how many times** to repeat.

### Syntax:
```javascript
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
  // code to repeat
}
```  


### Example: Count from 1 to 5
```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Count: " + i);
}
```  


👉 Output:
```javascript
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
```  


### How it works:
- `let i = 1` → start at 1
- `i <= 5` → continue while i is less than or equal to 5
- `i++` → increase i by 1 after each loop
