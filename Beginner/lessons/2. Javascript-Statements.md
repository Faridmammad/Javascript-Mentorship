# 📜 JavaScript Introduction: Statements

Welcome to the **Beginner Level** of our JavaScript Mentorship Program! In this lesson, you'll learn everything about **JavaScript statements** — the core building blocks of any JavaScript program.

<br><br>
## What is a Statement?

In JavaScript, a **statement** is a single instruction that tells the computer what to do. Think of it like a sentence in English: each statement performs a specific action. Statements are usually written one per line and end with a **semicolon (`;`)**.

### Example:
```javascript
let name = "Leyla";
console.log("Hello, " + name);
alert("JavaScript is fun!");
```  
> 🔹 Each line above is a **statement**.  
> 🔹 Semicolons separate statements. They are often optional due to ASI (Automatic Semicolon Insertion), but **always use them** for safety and clarity.

## Common Types of JavaScript Statements

Let’s explore the most important types of statements you’ll use every day.
<br>

### 1. Variable Declaration Statement

Creates a variable to store data.
```javascript
let age = 22;
const city = "Baku";
var oldStyle = "Avoid var";
```

> ✅ Use `const` for values that won’t change. Use `let` when you need to reassign.
<br>

### 2. Assignment Statement

Assigns or updates a value.
```javascript
let score;
score = 100;           // First assignment
score = score + 50;    // Update
score += 10;           // Short form
```

### 3. Expression Statement

Any valid expression is a statement.
```javascript
3 + 5;
"Hello" + "World";
x > 10;
```

These are often used inside other statements (like `console.log(3 + 5)`).

### 4. Function Declaration Statement

Defines a reusable block of code.
```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```  


Now you can call `greet("Tural")` anytime.

### 5. Conditional Statement (`if`, `else`)

Executes code based on a condition.
```javascript
let temperature = 28;
if (temperature > 25) {
  console.log("It's hot today!");
} else {
  console.log("It's cool outside.");
}
```  


### 6. Loop Statements

Repeat code multiple times.

#### `for` loop:
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("Count: " + i);
}
```  


#### `while` loop:
```javascript
let count = 1;
while (count <= 3) {
  console.log("Repeat: " + count);
  count++;
}
```  


### 7. Function Call Statement

Executes a function.
```javascript
greet("Nigar");            // Calls the function
console.log("Task done");  // Built-in function call
``` 


### 8. `return` Statement

Sends a value back from a function.
```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
let total = add(7, 3);  // total = 10
console.log(total);
``` 


## How JavaScript Executes Statements

JavaScript runs your code **from top to bottom, line by line**.

### Example:
```javascript
console.log("First");
console.log("Second");
console.log("Third");
```

👉 Output:

First  
Second  
Third

> ⚠️ Order matters! Even small changes can break your program.

## Semicolons: Best Practice

Although JavaScript can guess where statements end, **always use semicolons**.

✅ Recommended:
```javascript
let a = 1;
let b = 2;
console.log(a + b);  
```  

🚫 Avoid (can cause bugs):
```javascript
let a = 1
let b = 2
console.log(a + b) 
```  

> 💡 Rule: **End every statement with `;`** unless you're using a tool like Prettier that enforces ASI safely.

## 🧠 Quick Summary Table

| Statement Type       | Purpose                                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Variable Declaration | Store data (`let`, `const`)              |
| Assignment           | Give or update a value                   |
| Expression           | Compute a value                          |
| Function Declaration | Define reusable code                     |
| Conditional          | Make decisions (`if`, `else`)            |
| Loop                 | Repeat actions (`for`, `while`)          |
| Function Call        | Run a function                           |
| `return`             | Return a value from a function           |
