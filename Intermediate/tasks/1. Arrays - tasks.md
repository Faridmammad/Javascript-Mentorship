# 🧩 JavaScript: Arrays — tasks

Welcome to the practice section for **Advanced arrays**!  
Complete these tasks to master `push`, `pop`, `splice`, `slice`, `indexOf`, and `includes`.  
Write real code in your `script.js` file and test it in the browser.

> 📝 How to start:
> 1. Create `index.html` and `script.js`
> 2. Link script: `<script src="script.js"></script>`
> 3. Write your code in `script.js`
> 4. Open `index.html` in browser and check console (`F12`)

## Task 1: Add to end

Create an array: `let fruits = ["apple", "banana"];`  
Add `"orange"` and `"mango"` to the end using `push()`.  
Print the updated array.


---

## Task 2: Remove from end

Remove the last fruit using `pop()`.  
Print the removed fruit and the updated array.



---

## Task 3: Add to start

Add `"kiwi"` to the beginning of the array using `unshift()`.  
Print the array.



---

## Task 4: Remove from start

Remove the first fruit using `shift()`.  
Print the removed fruit and the updated array.



---

## Task 5: Check if exists

Use `includes()` to check if `"apple"` is still in the array.  
Print `"Apple found"` or `"Apple not found"`.


---

## Task 6: Find index

Use `indexOf()` to find the index of `"orange"`.  
If found, print `"Orange is at index X"`.  
If not, print `"Orange not found"`.



---

## Task 7: Copy first 3

Use `slice()` to copy the first 3 fruits into a new array `topFruits`.  
Print both arrays to confirm original is unchanged.



---

## Task 8: Copy last 2

Use `slice()` with negative index to copy the last 2 fruits.  
Print the new array.



---

## Task 9: Remove middle element

Use `splice()` to remove one element from index `1`.  
Print the updated array.



---

## Task 10: Insert in middle

Use `splice()` to insert `"grape"` and `"berry"` at index `1`.  
Print the array.



---

## Task 11: Replace element

Use `splice()` to replace `"banana"` with `"pineapple"`.  
First find its index, then replace.



---

## Task 12: Build a playlist

Create an array `playlist = ["Song 1", "Song 2"];`  
- Add `"Song 3"` and `"Song 4"` to end
- Remove the first song
- Add `"Intro"` to the beginning
- Use `slice()` to get last 2 songs
- Print current playlist



---

## Task 13: Shopping list

Create `let shopping = ["milk", "bread"];`  
- Add `"eggs"` and `"butter"`
- Check if `"bread"` exists
- Remove `"milk"` using `splice()` (find index first)
- Print final list


---

## Task 14: Fix the code

This code has errors. Find and fix them:

```javascript
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
colors.push yellow
colors.splice(1, 1)
console.log colors
``` 



---

## Task 15: Bonus challenge

Create an array of 5 numbers.  
Use a `for` loop and `includes()` to:
- Print `"Even and exists"` for each even number that’s in the array
- But only if it’s really there (avoid duplicates)


---

## 🎯 Tips

- `push`/`pop` → end  
- `unshift`/`shift` → start  
- `slice()` → safe copy  
- `splice()` → powerful but changes array  
- Always check `indexOf() !== -1` before using index
